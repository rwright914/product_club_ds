With iconic buildings, timeless design, thought-provoking cultural experiences, and elevated hospitality, NeueHouse has reimagined the ideal environment for creative potential and progress.\\n\\nOur Properties\\n\\nNeueHouse currently operates across three different, but equally iconic properties in New York City and Los Angeles:\\n• Our Madison Square (MSQ) House is situated in New York’s iconic Flatiron District, was previously home for Tepper Galleries, a well-known Manhattan auction house for international artists and collectors in the 1930s – and neighbors the 69th Regiment Armory where the first International Exhibition of Modern Art was held.\\n• Our Hollywood House (HWD), which sits on Sunset Boulevard, is one of LA’s most celebrated buildings and occupies the original CBS Studio (the world’s first structure built intentionally for broadcast). Here genre-defining artists from... Orson Wells and Lucille Ball, to Janis Joplin, the Beach Boys, and Bob Dylan built their legacy.\\n• Our Bradbury House (BB) sits within the Bradbury building in DTLA. Built-in 1893, the Bradbury Building is an architectural masterpiece and one of Los Angeles’ most historic landmarks. It has been heralded as one of the most thrilling spaces in all North America and is renowned for its breathtaking skylit atrium filled with walkways, stairs, balconies, and intricate ironwork.\\n\\nThese properties are complemented by forthcoming houses in Venice Beach, and Miami, as well as proposed European locations. Regardless of locale, and by deliberate design, all our environment and teams support, nurture and connect the NeueHouse community in reaching their creative potential.\\n\\nThe Role\\n\\nOur Food & Beverage team is a critical part of creating an outstanding NeueHouse experience and are tasked with sharing the NeueHouse food and drink philosophy with Members and Guests, alike. Baristas on our team create innovative and outstanding food and beverage journeys using our bespoke coffee, drink, and cocktail menus.\\n\\nBaristas represent NeueHouse in providing hospitality, warmth, and grace with all interactions, supporting, and adding to NeueHouse’s collaborative atmosphere, and making the most of every opportunity to enhance Member and Guest experience. NeueHouse’s team is lean and operates with a mindset of “no task is too small.”\\n\\nResponsibilities & Requirements\\n\\nSolution-oriented and taking pride in delivering with details in mind, Baristas build, deliver, and steward the everyday F&B moments defining NeueHouse for Members, Guests, and team. The role requires someone who is ready to:\\n• Consistently provide thoughtful and personal service with the goal to develop a rapport with members and guests.\\n• Ensure the Café counter and floor are set and ready for service.\\n• Maintain the cleanliness and always restock equipment of the Café counter and floor.\\n• Maintain thorough working knowledge of menus and be able to articulate to guests in an engaged and thoughtful manner.\\n• Proficient use of POS for ordering and billing purposes.\\n• Execution of the order of service in a timely and accurate manner with the goal of creating memorable service - we want Members and Guests to remember that cup of coffee!\\n• Prepare all food and beverages to the standards of NeueHouse and our partners.\\n• Thorough working knowledge of all beverages: coffee/tea/non-alcoholic/wines/beers/spirits.\\n• Communicating with prep kitchen to ensure areas are always fully stocked with food and beverage items, alerting the kitchen when running low on a particular item.\\n• Develop and coordinate the organization of various areas of The Café and other F&B outlets on property.\\n• Competency in conversing with members, guests, and potential members regarding NeueHouse and our various programs and amenities.\\n\\nWe are looking for new team members who can demonstrate they are:\\n• Proficient in brewing methods for Coffee, Tea, Espresso, and other common Drinks.\\n• Must be able to lift/move up to 10lbs, frequently lift/move up to 25lbs, and occasionally lift/move up to 50lbs.\\n• Committed to incredible teamwork and balance team and individual responsibilities.\\n• Impeccable customer service by responding promptly to member/guest needs, soliciting feedback to improve service, and responding to all member requests (not just F&B related)\\n• NeueHouse values diverse educational and training backgrounds in consideration of the role.\\n\\nCOVID19: The health and well-being of our Members and staff have been our number one priority and the guiding force behind all our decisions as we open our doors. We encourage you to learn more about our commitment to safety by reading the steps we have taken to ensure that all Members and teams feel safe, comfortable, and secure, going forward on our website.\\n\\nDiversity & Representation: NeueHouse is committed to building and supporting inclusive and representative communities, long-term career opportunities and extends Equal Employment Opportunities to qualified applicants and employees on an equal basis regardless of an individual's age, race, color, sex, religion, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, pregnancy status, marital status, military or veteran status, genetic disposition or any other reason protected by law\",\n",

With iconic buildings, timeless design, thought-provoking cultural experiences, and elevated hospitality, NeueHouse has reimagined the ideal environment for creative potential and progress.\\n\\nOur Properties\\n\\nNeueHouse currently operates across three different, but equally iconic properties in New York City and Los Angeles:\\n• Our Madison Square (MSQ) House is situated in New York’s iconic Flatiron District, was previously home for Tepper Galleries, a well-known Manhattan auction house for international artists and collectors in the 1930s – and neighbors the 69th Regiment Armory where the first International Exhibition of Modern Art was held.\\n• Our Hollywood House (HWD), which sits on Sunset Boulevard, is one of LA’s most celebrated buildings and occupies the original CBS Studio (the world’s first structure built intentionally for broadcast). Here genre-defining artists from... Orson Wells and Lucille Ball, to Janis Joplin, the Beach Boys, and Bob Dylan built their legacy.\\n• Our Bradbury House (BB) sits within the Bradbury building in DTLA. Built-in 1893, the Bradbury Building is an architectural masterpiece and one of Los Angeles’ most historic landmarks. It has been heralded as one of the most thrilling spaces in all North America and is renowned for its breathtaking skylit atrium filled with walkways, stairs, balconies, and intricate ironwork.\\n\\nThese properties are complemented by forthcoming houses in Venice Beach, and Miami, as well as proposed European locations. Regardless of locale, and by deliberate design, all our environment and teams support, nurture and connect the NeueHouse community in reaching their creative potential.\\n\\nThe Role\\n\\nOur Food & Beverage team is a critical part of creating an outstanding NeueHouse experience and are tasked with sharing the NeueHouse food and drink philosophy with Members and Guests, alike. Baristas on our team create innovative and outstanding food and beverage journeys using our bespoke coffee, drink, and cocktail menus.\\n\\nBaristas represent NeueHouse in providing hospitality, warmth, and grace with all interactions, supporting, and adding to NeueHouse’s collaborative atmosphere, and making the most of every opportunity to enhance Member and Guest experience.

The role requires someone who is ready to:\\n• Consistently provide thoughtful and personal service with the goal to develop a rapport with members and guests.\\n• Ensure the Café counter and floor are set and ready for service.\\n• Maintain the cleanliness and always restock equipment of the Café counter and floor.\\n• Maintain thorough working knowledge of menus and be able to articulate to guests in an engaged and thoughtful manner.\\n• Proficient use of POS for ordering and billing purposes.\\n• Execution of the order of service in a timely and accurate manner with the goal of creating memorable service - we want Members and Guests to remember that cup of coffee!\\n• Prepare all food and beverages to the standards of NeueHouse and our partners.\\n• Thorough working knowledge of all beverages: coffee/tea/non-alcoholic/wines/beers/spirits.\\n• Communicating with prep kitchen to ensure areas are always fully stocked with food and beverage items, alerting the kitchen when running low on a particular item.\\n• Develop and coordinate the organization of various areas of The Café and other F&B outlets on property.\\n• Competency in conversing with members, guests, and potential members regarding NeueHouse and our various programs and amenities.\\n\\nWe are looking for new team members who can demonstrate they are:\\n• Proficient in brewing methods for Coffee, Tea, Espresso, and other common Drinks.\\n• Must be able to lift/move up to 10lbs, frequently lift/move up to 25lbs, and occasionally lift/move up to 50lbs.\\n• Committed to incredible teamwork and balance team and individual responsibilities.\\n• Impeccable customer service by responding promptly to member/guest needs, soliciting feedback to improve service, and responding to all member requests (not just F&B related)\\n• NeueHouse values diverse educational and training backgrounds in consideration of the role.\\n\\nCOVID19: The health and well-being of our Members and staff have been our number one priority and the guiding force behind all our decisions as we open our doors. We encourage you to learn more about our commitment to safety by reading the steps we have taken to ensure that all Members and teams feel safe, comfortable, and secure, going forward on our website.\\n\\nDiversity & Representation: NeueHouse is committed to building and supporting inclusive and representative communities, long-term career opportunities and extends Equal Employment Opportunities to qualified applicants and employees on an equal basis regardless of an individual's age, race, color, sex, religion, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, pregnancy status, marital status, military or veteran status, genetic disposition or any other reason protected by law\",\n",
